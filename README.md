# PiWifiToggle
Code to toggle wifi and access point mode on my Raspberry Pi 3

Works for me after following [this](https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd/) guide to set up my Raspberry Pi as an access point with static IP 172.24.1.1

## To use
In order to switch from access point to wifi, invoke ```sudo bash toggle.sh -w```

Otherwise ```sudo bash toggle.sh```
